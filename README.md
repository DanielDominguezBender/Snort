In simple words, SNORT is like a digital security guard for computer networks. Imagine it as a superhero that watches over your network, looking for bad guys trying to break in or cause trouble.

## What is it used for?

Some things that <b>SNORT</b> does:

Detecting Intruders: Snort's main job is to spot suspicious activities happening in your network. It pays attention to the data passing through your network, just like a guard keeps an eye on people entering a building.

Rules and Patterns: Snort uses a set of rules, like a secret codebook. These rules describe the behavior of known digital bad guys. When Snort sees something matching these rules, it raises a red flag.

Alerts: When Snort finds something fishy, it doesn't just keep it to itself. It sends out an alert, like sounding an alarm. This alert tells your network administrators that something might be wrong.

Protection: Snort can also step in and block suspicious traffic, just like a bouncer at a club who refuses entry to troublemakers. This is called Intrusion Prevention.

Updates: Snort isn't static. It's regularly updated with new rules to recognize the latest threats. It's like giving your security guard new information about the bad guys in town.

Use Cases: Snort is used in all sorts of places, from big companies to small homes. It helps protect networks from cyberattacks, like viruses and hackers, and ensures that digital information stays safe.
